# Step-by-Step Migration Guide: JSON Files → Supabase

## 🎯 Your First Step: Set Up Supabase

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Wait for the project to be ready (usually 1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** (looks like: `https://your-project.supabase.co`)
3. Copy your **anon/public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 3: Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

## 🔄 Migrate Your Data

### Step 4: Run Migration Script
```bash
python migrate_to_supabase.py
```

This script will:
- ✅ Create backups of your JSON files
- ✅ Migrate custom projections to Supabase
- ✅ Migrate completed drafts to Supabase
- ✅ Show you the progress

### Step 5: Verify Migration
1. Check your Supabase dashboard → **Table Editor**
2. You should see two new tables:
   - `custom_projections`
   - `completed_drafts`
3. Verify your data is there

## 🚀 Test Your Application

### Step 6: Test Locally
```bash
python fantasy_draft_web_enhanced.py
```

Test these features:
- ✅ Custom projections are loaded from Supabase
- ✅ Completed drafts are loaded from Supabase
- ✅ New custom projections are saved to Supabase
- ✅ New completed drafts are saved to Supabase

## 🎉 You're Ready for Cloud Deployment!

### Step 7: Deploy to Cloud
Choose your platform:

**Railway (Recommended):**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables (same as your `.env` file)
4. Deploy!

**Render:**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy!

## 📊 What Changed

### Before (Local JSON Files):
- ❌ Data stored locally
- ❌ Not accessible to others
- ❌ No backup/versioning
- ❌ Single-user only

### After (Supabase):
- ✅ Data stored in cloud database
- ✅ Accessible from anywhere
- ✅ Automatic backups
- ✅ Multi-user support
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Secure and scalable

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails:
1. Check your `.env` file has correct credentials
2. Ensure your Supabase project is active
3. Check the error messages in the migration script
4. Verify your JSON files are valid

### If App Doesn't Work:
1. Check Supabase connection in logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check that tables were created in Supabase
4. Test with a simple custom projection

## 📝 Next Steps After Migration

1. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure everything works
2. **Delete JSON files** - Once you're confident data is migrated
3. **Deploy to cloud** - Use Railway, Render, or Heroku
4. **Share with others** - Your app is now accessible worldwide!

## 🎯 Summary

Your **first step** was setting up Supabase. Now your fantasy draft assistant:

- ✅ Stores all data in the cloud (Supabase)
- ✅ Is ready for multi-user access
- ✅ Can be deployed as a public website
- ✅ Has automatic backups and security
- ✅ Scales automatically

**Congratulations!** Your app is now cloud-ready and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection! 🚀
